 * \title Target 9 Game
 * \brief The program contains the source code for the "Target 9" Game.
 * \details The game starts with an initial configuration of digits that is set on
 * the difficulty level selected by the user and the userâ€™s target is to change all of them
 * to 9 in the minimum number of moves. The interaction with the game is done through the menu
 * in the command line, which allows to make moves using row and column indexes. undo and redo moves,
 * start a new game or finish the game.
