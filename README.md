# Target 9 Game

## Overview

The Target 9 Game is a command-line based game developed in C++. The game starts with an initial configuration of digits that is set on the difficulty level selected by the user. The userâ€™s target is to change all of them to 9 in the minimum number of moves. The interaction with the game is done through the menu in the command line, which allows to make moves using row and column indexes, undo and redo moves, start a new game or finish the game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (GCC recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the `main.cpp` file using your C++ compiler.
4. Run the compiled file to start the game.

## Usage

The game starts by asking the user to set the difficulty level. The difficulty level determines the number of random moves made at the beginning of the game. The user can then make moves, undo moves, redo moves, restart the game, or quit the game through the command-line menu.
